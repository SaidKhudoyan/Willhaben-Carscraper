# Willhaben-Carscraper
In the following you are going to see a webscraper for cars on the website willhaben. There are two files, that are of interest.

1. OneCar.py: This file contains all necessary functions to extract the data for an individual car.
2. Main.py: Here you have to provide a list of the cars you want to extract from the page.

For the scraper I used the BeautifulSoup module to extract the data and save them in a csv file. However, name of the seller and also phone number or email are not extracted due to privacy reasons.

NO COMMERCIAL USE! The scraper is only for private use only and should not be used to make profits nor should the data be given to 3rd party people/companies, as it would violate the terms and conditions of the website. The scraper was only created to get some hands-on experience to learn the basics of "Webscraping".
